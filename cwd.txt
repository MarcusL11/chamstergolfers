Questions for Meeting with Clowd With Django: 

1. I will need to update my database periodically from a 3rd party API.  
What are the steps to have this run periodically and automatically?  
What are the pros and cons I should be considering on the frequency occurence of calling the API to update?
Every 30 mins, 1hr, day, week? 

2. User to login with their WalletConnect.  The User will connect their Chia Wallet via WalletConnect, 
then the user will input their DID Profile to request a signature, WalletConnect sends a signature request to the DID profile, 
the user signs, and the authentication is complete. This process has been coded already, but how would I 
create a profile for the user in this session? Will I still be using the builtin User Database to create the user for them and sign in?
How about the password?
